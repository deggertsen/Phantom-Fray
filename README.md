# Phantom-Fray

You are a soldier in a world that is being invaded by an alien phantom race that cannot be touched or killed through by flesh or normal weaponry. A breakthrough has been made and you have been recruited and equipped with new melee weapons that effectively destroy the phantoms instantly once they are touched. But if enough of them get inside your body, they will suck out your life force and you will die. It is your mission to drive the invaders from the world and restore peace.

## Game Mechanics

This is a Virtual Reality game that uses a VR controller that has a gripper and a button. The player can use the gripper to punch the phantoms. The player is stationary but can dodge the phantoms. The phantoms will try to touch the player and if they do, the player will lose life force and the game will end. The player can punch the phantoms to destroy them and if they destroy enough of them, they will win the game.

1. Player Movement:
   - Stationary position with ability to dodge, duck, and possibly jump
   - Focus on upper body movement for punching
   - Dodge enemy projectiles at times by doing squats or dodging to the side

2. Phantom Behavior and Combat:
   - Phantoms approach the player from various angles
   - Each phantom type has a "sweet spot" for maximum points (points are what are needed to close the rifts)
   - Encourage different punch types (jabs, hooks, uppercuts, punch while squatting) for optimal scoring

3. Weapon System:
   - Start with special energy gloves for punching
   - Possible special abilities on cooldown for variety (not in initial release)

4. Health/Life Force System:
   - Visual indicator of phantom "infection" (glowing veins?)
   - Heartbeat audio cue that intensifies as life force depletes

5. Progression:
   - Story-driven progression
   - Save Earth as the primary goal
   - Potential for DLC with off-planet missions or Earth mission replays

Other possible features or mechanics we may want to add:

1. Combo System: Reward players for chaining together successful hits on sweet spots. This could increase a multiplier for points or charge up a special ability faster.

2. Phantom Variety: Even without different weapons, we could have phantoms that require specific punch combinations to defeat. Like a "shield" phantom that needs a specific 1-2-3 punch combo to break its defenses.

3. Environmental Hazards: While we're not doing full environment interaction, what about simple hazards that appear randomly? Things like energy beams that you need to duck under or phantom projectiles you need to punch away.

4. Power-Ups: Temporary boosts that appear in your reach. Grab them for effects like slowing down time, increasing punch power, or restoring life force.

5. Boss Battles: Larger phantoms that require more complex strategies to defeat. These could be tied to story progression.

## Lore

Title: "Phantom Fray: Resonance Rising"

In 2142, humanity's reach exceeded its grasp. Our experiments with interdimensional energy, meant to revolutionize space travel, instead tore the fabric of reality. On the day known as "The Breach," ethereal entities we called "Phantoms" began pouring through microscopic rifts, impervious to conventional weapons and hungry for life force.

Dr. Elara Chen, the brilliant mind behind the ill-fated experiments, had created a revolutionary technology called the "Ethereal Resonance Matrix" (ERM). Originally designed to safely interact with interdimensional energies, ERM became humanity's unexpected salvation.

As cities fell silent and governments crumbled, Dr. Chen made a startling discovery. By inverting the ERM's energy signature, it could negate Phantom energy, effectively destroying them. However, this came with a catch: the ERM required a direct connection to a living being's life force to function. Projectile weapons were impossible; the fight against the Phantoms would have to be up close and personal.

Enter the Resonance Strike Force (RSF), a desperate initiative to turn the tide. You are one of the newest recruits, chosen for your exceptional physical abilities and mental fortitude. Your mission: master the ERM gauntlets and take the fight to the Phantoms.

As you progress through training and into active duty, you'll uncover crucial information:

1. The Phantoms aren't just random invaders, but pawns of a greater intelligence dubbed "The Overseer."
2. Each Phantom has a "resonance point" where its connection to The Overseer is strongest. Striking these points causes maximum disruption to the Phantom network.
3. Your actions aren't just defeating individual Phantoms, but systematically weakening the entire invasion force.

Your missions with the RSF will be twofold: closing the dimensional rifts scattered across the globe and gathering crucial intelligence on the Phantoms and their mysterious Overseer. Each successful operation not only pushes back the invasion but also pieces together the puzzle of the Phantoms' origin and nature.

Throughout the story, we can explore:
- The ethical implications of using life force-powered technology
- The camaraderie and rivalries within the RSF
- The weight of being humanity's last, best hope

This setup maintains the epic scale of our conflict while focusing on the player's personal journey from recruit to humanity's champion. It also leaves room for future expansions - perhaps discovering other dimensions affected by The Breach or exploring the long-term effects of ERM use.

Rift-closing missions: These could be intense, time-pressured battles where you need to fight off waves of Phantoms while Dr. Chen's team works to seal a rift.
Intelligence-gathering missions: These might involve capturing specific Phantom types or targeting Phantoms that seem to be relaying information.
Escalating challenge: As you close more rifts and learn more about the Phantoms, they could adapt their strategies, introducing new types of enemies or behaviors.
Story progression: Each bit of intel could reveal more about the Phantoms' hierarchy, the nature of the Overseer, and potentially ways to strike at the heart of the invasion.
Final confrontation: All of this could build up to a climactic mission where you use everything you've learned to open a rift to the Phantoms' dimension and take the fight to the Overseer.

### The Phantom Threat

1. Phantom Physiology:
   - Phantoms are energy beings composed of negative life force.
   - They exist in a state of constant hunger, driven to consume positive life energy to maintain their form in our dimension.

2. The Consumption Process:
   - When a Phantom touches a living being, it begins to siphon life force through a process we could call "ethereal osmosis."
   - The victim experiences a sensation of extreme cold, followed by weakness, disorientation, and eventually, total systemic failure.
   - The process can take anywhere from seconds to minutes, depending on the size and power of the Phantom.

3. Visible Effects:
   - As life force is drained, victims develop a pale, almost translucent appearance.
   - Glowing, vein-like patterns may appear on the skin, tracing the path of energy extraction.
   - In the final stages, victims may emit a faint, ghostly glow before collapsing.

4. Environmental Impact:
   - Areas with high Phantom activity become cold and lifeless.
   - Plants wither, animals flee, and the very air seems to become thin and hard to breathe.
   - In severe cases, the laws of physics may begin to break down, causing localized reality distortions.

5. Phantom Evolution:
   - As Phantoms consume more life force, they grow larger and more powerful.
   - Some may evolve specialized abilities, like faster movement or the power to drain life force from a distance.
   - The most powerful Phantoms can drain entire crowds simultaneously.

6. The Hive Mind Effect:
   - The Overseer uses the consumed life force to create more Phantoms and strengthen its control over Earth's dimension.
   - This creates a feedback loop: more consumption leads to more Phantoms, which leads to more consumption.

7. Humanity's Desperate Measures:
   - Conventional weapons are useless, leading to panic and mass exoduses from cities.
   - Some humans, in desperation, have formed cults that worship the Phantoms, offering themselves as willing sacrifices.
   - Governments resort to extreme measures like scorched earth tactics, hoping to deprive Phantoms of life force to consume.

8. The ERM Advantage:
   - The ERM gauntlets don't just destroy Phantoms; they can also temporarily reverse the life force drain in recently affected victims.
   - This makes RSF operators not just warriors, but potential saviors, adding an extra layer of urgency to their missions.
