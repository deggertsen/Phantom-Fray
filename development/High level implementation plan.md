   - **Progression System**
     - **Story-Driven Progression**
       - Set up mission objectives and checkpoints.
     - **DLC and Expansion Handling**
       - Plan for future expansions and modular content loading.

### 3. **Game Mechanics**
   - **Player Movement**
     - Implement stationary dodging, ducking, and possible jumping.
     - Focus on upper body movements for VR interactions.
   - **Phantom Behavior and Combat**
     - Diverse approaches and attack patterns for phantoms.
     - Encourage varied punch types for scoring.
   - **Weapon System**
     - Basic energy gloves with plans for special abilities.

     - Visual and audio indicators for health status.
   - **Progression**
     - Story elements intertwined with gameplay progression.

### 4. **Additional Features**
   - **Combo System**
     - Reward chaining successful hits on sweet spots.
     - Implement score multipliers and ability charge-ups.
   - **Phantom Variety**
     - Different phantom types requiring specific punch combinations.
     - Implement specialized phantoms like "shield" phantoms.
   - **Environmental Hazards**
     - Introduce simple hazards like energy beams or projectiles.
   - **Power-Ups**
     - Design temporary boosts (e.g., time slow, punch power increase).
   - **Boss Battles**
     - Larger phantoms with complex defeat strategies tied to story progression.

### 5. **User Interface (UI)**
   - **Main Menu**
     - Design an intuitive VR-compatible main menu.
   - **In-Game HUD**
     - Display life force, score, and other vital stats.
