# Phantom Design Prompts for Meshy.ai

## Basic Phantom
"Ethereal humanoid figure, semi-transparent with flowing energy tendrils, dark purple core in chest area, wispy edges that fade to transparency. Smooth, curved forms with no sharp edges. Center mass clearly defined for jab targeting."

## Warrior Phantom
"Tall phantom warrior, translucent armor pieces floating around a humanoid form, bright energy core in chest, side panels perfect for hook punches, ghostly cape that flows upward. Style: Mix of samurai and sci-fi aesthetic."

## Brute Phantom
"Massive, bulky phantom figure, crystalline structure with multiple energy cores, broad shoulders with clear side target zones, pronounced lower body perfect for uppercuts. Intimidating but elegant design with flowing energy patterns."

## Scout Phantom
"Sleek, agile phantom form, quick-moving energy streams, multiple small cores distributed across body, thin but defined center mass. Design should suggest speed and agility while maintaining clear target zones."

## Elite Phantom
"Regal phantom entity, complex geometric patterns of flowing energy, multiple interconnected cores, elegant but threatening presence. Distinct target zones marked by brighter energy concentrations. Mix of organic and geometric forms."

## Boss Phantom: The Overseer
"Imposing phantom lord, multiple rotating energy rings around a central form, crown-like structure, multiple cores that must be targeted in sequence. Architectural and organic elements combined, with clear visual hierarchy of target zones."
